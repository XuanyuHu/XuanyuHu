😎 About me 😎
---
    
With over a decade of experience in full-stack 🖥️ development, I specialize in creating 🔒 secure and 📈 scalable solutions for the 🏥 healthcare industry, focusing on integrating 💻 technology seamlessly with healthcare needs.

My expertise includes 🔑 Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations, such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and implementing OAuth 2.0 for 🔐 secure authorization and authentication.

I also bring deep knowledge in interoperability standards like HL7, FHIR, and 🏥 Healthcare EDI, enabling efficient 🔄 data exchange across systems. All recent projects utilized Mirth® Connect by NextGen Healthcare for seamless integration.

This included 📄 CCD integration into Epic systems, enabling secure document exchange with direct C-CDA and PDF workflows. Additionally, FHIR and Carequality/Commonwell were used for enhanced EMR data sharing. HL7 MDM was implemented for secure 🗄️ medical data management.

On the backend, I develop high-performance systems with Node.js and Express, using MySQL and Redis for efficient 📊 data management. My frontend development uses React.js and Next.js to deliver intuitive user experiences.

I have extensive experience designing scalable ☁️ cloud infrastructure on AWS and Azure, utilizing Docker 🐳 and Kubernetes for container orchestration, and automating CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

My mission is to drive advancements in 🏥 healthcare through 💻 technology, focusing on improving operational efficiency, enhancing 🧑‍⚕️ patient outcomes, and creating seamless workflows.
